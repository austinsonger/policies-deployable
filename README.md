# Catalyze Policies (Deployable)

**Interested in just the markdown files? Those are located in our [policies](https://github.com/catalyzeio/policies) repo.**

Within the interest of our loyal customers we've decided to build a deployable version of our widely popular open source compliance policies. This body of work will provide you with the ability to quickly edit, build, and publish your very own version of our policies.

We encourage contributions and adaption to this project. For guidelines on how to contribute please see the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
